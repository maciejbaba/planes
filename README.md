project of a single page app using tailwind, react and typescript

link: https://maciejbaba.github.io/planes/

in this project I was learning react, responsiveness, CI/CD, tailwind, typescript
I had main problems with making it properly responsive, setting up basic CI/CD. also this hacky way of making tailwind classes in seperate variables was somewhat tricky
